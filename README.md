# mission-to-mars
Web scraping with HTML/CSS

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a script that combined all the information Robin, a junior Data Scientist, searches for and scrapes about Mars into one convenient and central location that could be shared with other external audiences - and may even receive NASA's attention. 

The final product was a web application created to scrape information regarding the Mission to Mars with a click of a button. However, before scraping, a python script was built to navigate webpages to collect the right information. Once all the data was collected, a NoSQL database, MongoDB, was used to store the data. Then, to put it all together, using Flask - the web framework - allowed us to create a web applicaion and customize it using HTML and CSS.

## Results 

Below are the results of the final web application with bootstrap elements:
